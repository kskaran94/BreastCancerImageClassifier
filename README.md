# BreastCancerImageClassifier

The data used can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images

In this script we have build three iterations of model.

1. Base CNN model with Batch normalization and no residual connections
2. Enhanced the base model using augmented data by applying different transformations on images
3. The third model is using residual connections.

Our objective was to try different techniques on CNN base model and analyze the results. We have used only 2000 images due to computational constraints. The accuracy can increase by taking the entire data.
